<h4>Here's a moderately accurate map of the area so you can find your way around when you arrive.</h4>
<p>The Camping areas are enormous, and go on way outisde the area covered on this map, so if you're in a tent and want peace and quiet at night, you can find a nice spot in the woods (top of the map) or towards the big river (right of the map), where there's extra toilets and things.</p>
