<h4>
	Here's a moderately accurate map of the area so you can find your way around
	when you arrive.
</h4>
<p>
	The Camping areas are enormous, and extend way outside the area covered on
	this map, so if you're in a tent and want peace and quiet at night, you can
	find a nice spot in the woods (top of the map) or towards the big river (right
	of the map), where there's extra toilets and things.
</p>
<p>
	We'll be spending most of the time in the decked area outside the Big and
	Small Cabins, where food will be served, and the party will party.
