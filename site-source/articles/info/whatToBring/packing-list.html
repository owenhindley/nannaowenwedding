<h4>
	Here's a suggested packing list of things to bring to make sure you're
	prepared for whatever the weather's throwing at us!
</h4>
<h5>General:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Good shoes (i.e. ones that will keep your feet dry if it rains)</li>
	<li>Warm thick socks</li>
	<li>
		Thermal leggings / long johns (you can wear them underneath trousers / a
		skirt, and be warm whilst still looking fabulous)
	</li>
	<li>Thermal top (see above)</li>
	<li>
		Layers of clothes that you can put on or take off as it gets warmer / colder
		throughout the day.
	</li>
	<li>Sunglasses</li>
	<li>Waterproof jacket (also good if there's a bit of wind)</li>
	<li>
		Swimsuit (if you're staying longer, we strongly reccommend taking a dip in
		any of the local swimming pools - they all have high quality hot tubs and
		saunas, and are very affordable)
	</li>
</ul>

<h5>If you're staying in a tent:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>A tent</li>
	<li>Good inflatable mattress / rollmat</li>
	<li>Pillow (or a jacket stuffed into a T-shirt works well)</li>
	<li>
		Sleeping bag that's comfortable down to 0 degrees (it won't get that cold,
		but if you bring a good one you're guaranteed a good night's sleep)
	</li>
	<li>Eyemask (because it gets bright at 5am)</li>
</ul>

<h5>If you're staying in the cabin:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>
		Sleeping bag / duvet + bedsheet (the beds are just a bare mattress, so
		you'll need something to cover them)
	</li>
	<li>Pillow</li>
	<li>Earplugs (in case someone's snoring)</li>
	<li>Eyemask (because it gets bright at 5am)</li>
</ul>

<h6>Food &amp; Drink</h6>
<ul>
	<li>
		We're providing wine, beer and some basic spirits the whole weekend. But if
		there's a specific tipple you're craving, your best (and cheapest) bet is to
		buy it in the duty-free on your way in (alcohol tax is quite high in
		Iceland, especially for high-percentage drinks)
	</li>
</ul>
