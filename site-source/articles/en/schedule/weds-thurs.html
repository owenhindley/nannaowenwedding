<p>
    We'll be at the campsite from at least Thursday beforehand, but more likely Wednesday or even Tuesday in order to get everything ready. If you would like to join us (and maybe even help getting things set up), we would absolutely love you to.

<p>Just please bear in mind the limited food options available!</p>
