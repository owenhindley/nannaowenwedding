<h3>
There's a saying in Iceland: "If you don't like the weather, just wait 5 minutes".
</h3> 
<p>There's another saying: "There's no such thing as bad weather, just being poorly dressed".

<p>Although Þórsmörk is famed for having more pleasant weather than its surrounding area, due to the fact that the area is circled by mountains that keep most of the wind at bay, there is still a high chance of unpleasant weather. 
</p>
<p>This may come in the form of rain, wind or even snow/hail. If we're lucky, there'll be pleasant sunshine throughout the weekend, but you'd be wise to prepare for the worst but hope for the best. Also note that the area is in a green birch area, right next to a glacier and a volcano, so contrasts can be extreme in both landscape and weather.</p>

Temperature may range from anything between 5°C-25°C, but one thing is for certain - <strong>there will be daylight until close to midnight, and darkness will only last for about 2-3 hours.</strong></p>
