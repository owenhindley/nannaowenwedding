<h4>
	If you don't already live in Iceland, it's very likely you'll need to book a
	ticket on a plane to get to our wedding.
</h4>
<h5>
	(because Iceland is surrounded by sea and quite a long way away from anything
	else.)
</h5>
<br />

<p>
	Keflavik is a small airport in the south-west of Iceland, and if you look out
	of the right window when you're coming in from mainland Europe, you can see
	Þórsmörk from above!
</p>

<h4>
	From Keflavik Airport - it's a 4 hour drive with stops to the venue (3 hours
	from Reykjavík).
</h4>
<p>
	We highly recommend arriving on the Thursday at the latest to break up the
	journey, spending a night in either Reykjavík, or Hvolsvöllur, and then
	arriving at Básar on the Friday.
</p>
<p>
	We've arranged a discount for the Thursday night for a limited number of rooms
	at
	<a href="https://midgardbasecamp.is/" target="_blank">Midgard hostel</a> in Hvolsvöllur - you
	can book directly with them <a href="mailto:sleep@midgard.is">by email</a>,
	and by mentioning "Nanna & Owen's Wedding" you'll be able to get either :
    <ul>
        <li>Ensuite 4-person family room (8000isk / person)</li>
            <li>Shared bathroom 4-person family room (7225isk / person)</li>
            <li>Bed in a 6-person dorm (7500isk / person)</li>
    </ul> 
</p>

<h4>Once you've landed, your transport options are:</h4>
<br />
<ul>
	<li>
		<h5>Take a transfer bus to Reykjavik, and another bus to Básar</h5>
		(45 minutes - we recommend <a href="https://www.re.is/tour/flybus/" target="_blank">FlyBus</a>) Depending on when you arrive, spend some
		time in Reykjavik before taking another bus to Þórsmörk Básar.
		<br /><strong><em>- or -</em></strong>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>Hire a small car at the airport, drive to Hvolsvöllur, take a bus</h5>
		Go for a sightseeing drive, park the car at Hvolsvöllur and take a bus to
		Þórsmörk Básar (you can't drive a regular car the whole way due to river
		crossings)
		<br /><strong><em>- or -</em></strong>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>Hire a 4x4 at the airport, drive the whole way</h5>
		If you're experienced at 4x4 driving on rugged terrain, and are confident
		with deep river crossings, you can hire a bigger car and drive the whole way
		to Básar yourself. There's one significant river crossing, to a depth of
		around 1m (depending on the weather). Check with the rental company that
		it's suitable for F-roads, and that you can drive to Básar.
		<br /><strong><em>- or -</em></strong>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>Hire a 4x4 campervan</h5>
		See <a href="#accommodationAnchor">Accommodation</a> section - and solve
		your transport and accommodation at the same time! See above notes about 4x4
		rentals and the route.
	</li>
</ul>
<h4>Getting back</h4>
<p>
	Buses leave Básar in the afternoon, so if you're leaving Iceland on the
	Sunday, book your flights from Keflavik no earlier than 9pm to leave enough
	time for the return bus trip.
</p>
<br />

<h4>
	We may also be chartering / hiring buses to make the journey more
	straightforward (and fun!).
</h4>
<p>
	We realise that we're bringing you all to a place that's quite a trek to get
	to, but it's all part of a plan to trap you all for three days so we can hang
	out properly!
</p>

	<em>
		Þórsmörk does technically have its own airport (<a
			href="https://www.greatcirclemapper.net/en/airport/BITM-thorsmoerk-airport.html"
			target="_blank"
			>BITM</a
		>), but you might struggle to find people to fly you there, and most
		importantly there is no duty-free, passport control, baggage handling staff
		or buildings, so we recommend Keflavik to be on the safe side.
