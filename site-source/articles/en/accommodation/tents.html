<p>
    Tents are the simplest option, and camping in the woods at
    Þórsmörk is a great experience.</p>
    <p> You can find a nice secluded spot
    in the forest next to a river (to keep the beer cool), or camp in
    one of the large, open spaces with benches and public grills. The
    area is large, but easy to navigate.

<h5>The campsite charges 2000 ISK per person per night for tents.</h5>
