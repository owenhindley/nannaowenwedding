<div class="trio-container">
	<div class="trio">
		<img src="../images/cabins/cabin-small.jpg" />
		<h4>A bed in one of the two cabins</h4>
	</div>

	<div class="trio">
		<img src="../images/campervan/campervan-cropped.jpeg" />
		<h4>Bring a 4x4 campervan or sturdy caravan</h4>
	</div>

	<div class="trio">
		<img src="../images/tents/tents-0.jpg" />
		<h4>A tent!</h4>
	</div>
</div>

<h4 class="centerAlign">
	We've booked out both cabins for the entire weekend, so you'll have access to
	everything mentioned below, even if you're not sleeping there.
