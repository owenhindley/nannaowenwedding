<p>
	They have exactly what you'd want after a day or four living out of a backpack
	and sleeping in a tent. Hot showers, electricity, 4G signal, toilets, a small
	shop and even a bar.
</p>

<p>
	The shop sells hot dogs, grilled sandwiches, snacks and a limited amount of
	spare camping bits.
</p>
<p>
	You won't be able to buy a new sleeping bag there, but they may sell you a
	pair of thick woolly socks when you discover that your H&M ankle socks aren't
	quite cutting it.
</p>

<h4>
	As you can see from the photos, it's bunk-bed style sleeping, and you'll need
	to bring your own bedding (a sleeping bag or duvet / bedcovers).
</h4>
<br />

<p>
	The cabins are both very warm and cosy, have power points, toilets, showers
	(with underfloor heating!) and kitchen which you'll have full acess to
	regardless of whether you're staying there or not.
</p>

<p>
	As we won't be able to fit all our guests in the cabins, we're giving priority
	to those coming from abroad. Please let us know when you RSVP which type of
	accommodation you're most likely to want to use.
</p>

<h5>
	We're getting a special deal on the cabins, two nights for 10,000 ISK per
	person.
