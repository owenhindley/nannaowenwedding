<p>
	Meaning you can absolutely dress up - the more fabulous or outrageous the
	better for our part - but bear in mind that it may get a little cold.
</p>

<h4>Key items to have with you are:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>fleece or wool jumper</li>
	<li>thermal underwear</li>
	<li>thick socks</li>
	<li>gloves and hats</li>
	<li>something to wear if it rains</li>
</ul>

<p>
	So ditch the high heels in favour of a nice pair of boots or comfortable
	shoes, and Gore-Tex beats Brogues any day of the week. Hiking shoes or sturdy
	trainers are even better as we'll be going for a short walk up the mountain
	post-ceremony to take photos.
</p>
<p>
	A suit, however, is still a suit if you're wearing a layer of thermals
	underneath (that's what Owen'll be wearing), and woollen jumpers with tights
	are a timeless Icelandic wedding look.
</p>

<p>
	The key to dressing for Iceland is layers - take them off when the sun comes
	out and you're sunbathing on a grassy hill, put them on when it starts
	hailing. No joke, we've had both of these things within the space of 4 hours,
	in BÃ¡sar, at this time of year.
