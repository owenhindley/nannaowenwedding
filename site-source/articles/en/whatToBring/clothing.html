<h4>
    Dress code is :
    <br/> Glastonbury Festival, with UK October weather.
</h4>
<p>
    Meaning you can absolutely dress up - the more fabulous or
    outrageous the better for our part - but bear in mind that it may
    get a little cold.
</p>

<p>
    So ditch the high heels in favour of a nice pair of boots or
    comfortable shoes, and Gore-Tex beats Brogues any day of the week.
</p>

<p>
    A suit, however, is still a suit if you're wearing a layer of
    thermals underneath (that's what Owen'll be wearing), and woollen
    jumpers with tights are a timeless Icelandic wedding look.
</p>

<p>
    The key to dressing for Iceland is layers - take them off when the
    sun comes out and you're sunbathing on a grassy hill, put them on
    when it starts hailing. No joke, we've had both of these things
    within the space of 4 hours, in BÃ¡sar, at this time of year.
