<h3>You showing up and partying with us is the best gift we can ask for.</h3>
<p>We have a small apartment, that's recently been fixed up.</p>
<p>We don't need any material presents, and honestly don't have the space for any of them either!</p> 
<h4>But if you really want to give us something, we'd love for people to get involved with the weekend.</h4>
    <p>We both find it fun to get involved with events and having a task to do, so if you want to contribute to making this a little camping festival, that would be fantastic - and we should be able to find a task for anyone coming over, just get in touch.</p>
<p>For example, we have very talented friends and family members, and there will be an â€˜open-mic' on the Friday night where guests can perform a song, or a cabaret or circus act or lead guests in a group game. On the Saturday there's free time early in the day if anyone would want to lead a yoga or dance class, or even a writing workshop - and there's also space for speeches before dancing takes over.</p>
<p>And if you don't feel like contributing in an artistic way, we might ask you to shop for us in the duty-free on your way over, help with signage or decoration, or find you a task you'd be happy with.</p>
