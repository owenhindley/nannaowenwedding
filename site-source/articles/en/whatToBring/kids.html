<p>
	As much as we love your kids, we're hoping to spend this time with you! We're
	therefore asking if it's possible to find a way for you to be kid-free at the
	weekend, so you can enjoy the weekend to the fullest!
</p>

<p>
	We also do understand that many of you are travelling from abroad (some from
	very far), so it's not possible to leave your kids behind.
</p>

<p>
	In that case, please message us - Básar is a large campground and popular with
	families, and Þórsmörk (well, Iceland in general) is a great environment for
	kids with wide open spaces and no dangerous plants or animals. The nature
	however can be a little tricky (fast, deep, cold rivers and steep rock faces)
	so it's good to be prepared.
