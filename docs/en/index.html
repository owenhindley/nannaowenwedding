<header>About Us</header>
<img class="floatLeft" src="../images/about-us/engagement-0.jpg" />

<h3>
	Chances are, if you're reading this, you already know us (or at least one of
	us).
</h3>
<h5>* But here's a little recap of our story.</h5>
<p>
	Nanna moved to London from Reykjav√≠k in 2009 to study European theatre. Owen
	moved to London in 2010 from Guildford to start work for Metropolis recording
	studio. At Metropolis he got to know his first Icelander, Ragnar, and he
	subsequently moved in with Ragnar and all his badgers. Coincidentally, Owen
	and Ragnar share the same birthday.
</p>
<p>
	Nanna studied with another Icelander, Brynja, who started dating Ragnar - whom
	Nanna had put dibs on. (Brynja and Ragnar are still together and now have a
	baby).
</p>
<p>
	In 2012, around the time that Owen and Ragnar had a birthday, they had a film
	night at their place, and Brynja brought Nanna along to it. Nanna flirted the
	entire evening with Owen, who took no notice of it.
</p>
<p>
	A couple of months later, Owen was dragged along to an Icelandic Eurovision
	party in a pub in west London, meeting Nanna a second time, this time partying
	with Iceland's craziest Eurovision fan, her sister Tinna. After a long night
	of searching for a party in the city that falls asleep at 11pm, Owen and Nanna
	got to crash at the sofa at Tinna's place (after an encounter with an armed
	police officer).
</p>
<p>
	As they walked away the next day, Tinna remarked that they had a ‚Äúhj√≥nasvipur‚Äù
	(Icelandic word for ‚Äúlooking like they'll get hitched‚Äù). This was shortly
	before Nanna graduated, and intended to leave London. A week later they went
	on their first ‚Äúdate‚Äù - at a one day music festival in London, and a month
	later Owen came to Iceland for the first time, hiking the Fimmv√∂r√∞uh√°ls hike
	to √û√≥rsm√∂rk.
</p>
<p>
	At Edinburgh Fringe festival they had the ‚Äúcouple talk‚Äù, immediately followed
	by Nanna asking to live with Owen for a short 2 month stint before travelling
	to Brazil and Argentina.
</p>
<h5>- Next 10 years in short: -</h5>
<p>
	Nanna managed to get Owen to travel around the world for fun, and Owen managed
	to get Nanna to stick around in London for 4 more years and learn to drink
	tea. They have both spent 7 years of their lives in London, and have now spent
	7 years living together in Iceland. When they moved to Iceland they founded a
	theatre company together, Huldufugl, which has enabled them to create projects
	together and perform around the world, working with projects as diverse as
	circus, virtual reality, ABBA and Fringe festivals.
</p>
<p>
	After spending a decade together, they got married in a small ceremony in
	Reykjav√≠k on Nanna's parents wedding anniversary date, 11.11.22.
</p>

<h3>
	However, now it's time to have the big party with friends we've gathered in
	one place from around the world, people we've met on various travels and
	adventures.
</h3>
<p>
	This weekend will be coloured by our many travels and experiences, mixing
	Icelandic, British and Brazilian culture, and even with a dash of Indian
	culture. We can't wait for our British, Icelandic, Brazilian, Indian,
	Australian, American, African and all over European friends to meet each
	other, surrounded by the impressive √û√≥rsm√∂rk natural beauty!

<h3>
	√û√≥rsm√∂rk is a valley in South Iceland - <br />
	bordered on one side by Eyjafjallaj√∂kull <br />(yep, that volcano from
	2010)<br />
	and the Icelandic highlands on the other.
</h3>
<br />
<img class="floatLeft" src="../images/location/basar-1.jpg" />
<p>
	The campground / cabin area in √û√≥rsm√∂rk we'll be in is called B√°sar, the
	largest and best-equipped in the valley. It's also the most accessible, as you
	don't have to cross the main river (Kross√°) to get there.
</p>

<p>
	It's surrounded by dramatic rocky outcrops, cosy forests, tiny glacial streams
	and woody paths winding up to epic mountainside meadows where you might just
	catch sight of an arctic fox - or find some wild blueberries to snack on.
</p>

<p>
	In one direction you can see glaciers & the red-orange mountains towards
	Landmannalaugar, in the other direction you can see to the coast and the North
	Sea.
</p>

<h4>
	It's one of the most beautiful places in all of Iceland, and we're excited to
	transform this stunning, rustic place into our own little festival for you
	all, with soundsystem, lights and live music. (And if you want to perform too,
	that's great!)
</h4>

            </article><article id="section-weather" class="location">
                <header>The Weather</header>
                
<h3>
	There's a saying in Iceland: "If you don't like the weather, just wait 5
	minutes".
</h3>
<p>
	There's another saying: "There's no such thing as bad weather, just being
	poorly dressed".
</p>
<img src="../images/weather/weather-1.jpg" class="floatRight small" />

<p>
	Although √û√≥rsm√∂rk is famed for having more pleasant weather than its
	surrounding area, due to the fact that the area is circled by mountains that
	keep most of the wind at bay, there is still a high chance of unpleasant
	weather.
</p>
<p>
	This may come in the form of rain, wind or even snow/hail. If we're lucky,
	there'll be pleasant sunshine throughout the weekend, but you'd be wise to
	prepare for the worst but hope for the best. Also note that the area is in a
	green birch area, right next to a glacier and a volcano, so contrasts can be
	extreme in both landscape and weather.
</p>
<img src="../images/what-to-wear/volcano.jpg" class="floatLeft small" />
<p>
	Temperature may range from anything between 5¬∞C-25¬∞C, but one thing is for
	certain -
	<strong
		>there will be daylight until close to midnight, and darkness will only last
		for about 2-3 hours.</strong

<h4>
	If you don't already live in Iceland, it's very likely you'll need to book a
	ticket on a plane to get to our wedding.
</h4>
<img src="../images/travel/iceland-map-annotated.jpeg" class="floatRight" />
<h5>
	(because Iceland is surrounded by sea and quite a long way away from anything
	else.)
</h5>
<br />



<p>
	Keflavik is a small airport in the south-west of Iceland, and if you look out
	of the right window when you're coming in from mainland Europe, you can see
	√û√≥rsm√∂rk from above!
</p>


<h5>
	We recommend arriving in Iceland on Thursday 24th if you can - to break up the
	journey. 
</h5>
<p>
	From the airport you can then spend the night in either Reykjav√≠k or Hvolsv√∂llur, and then
	arrive at B√°sar on the Friday. From Keflavik Airport it's a 4 hour drive with stops to the venue, and from Reykjav√≠k it's about 3 hours.
</p>
<h5>
	We've arranged a discount for the Thursday night for a limited number of rooms
	at
	<a href="https://midgardbasecamp.is/" target="_blank">Midgard hostel</a> in Hvolsv√∂llur</h5>
	<p>You
	can book directly with them <a href="mailto:sleep@midgard.is">by email</a>,
	and by mentioning "Nanna & Owen's Wedding" you'll be able to get :
	<div class="trio-container">
		<div class="trio">
			<p>Ensuite 4-person family room (8000isk / person)</p>
		</div>
		<div class="trio">
			<p>Shared bathroom 4-person family room (7225isk / person)</p>
		</div>
		<div class="trio">
			<p>Bed in a 6-person dorm (7500isk / person)</p>
		</div>
	</div>

</p>
   
</p>

<h4>Once you've landed, your transport options are:</h4>
<br />
<ul>
	<li>
		<h5>Take a transfer bus to Reykjavik, and another bus to B√°sar</h5>
		(45 minutes - we recommend <a href="https://www.re.is/tour/flybus/" target="_blank">FlyBus</a>) Depending on when you arrive, spend some
		time in Reykjavik before taking another bus to √û√≥rsm√∂rk B√°sar.
		<br /><strong><em>- or -</em></strong>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>Hire a small car at the airport, drive to Hvolsv√∂llur, take a bus</h5>
		Go for a sightseeing drive, park the car at Hvolsv√∂llur and take a bus to
		√û√≥rsm√∂rk B√°sar (you can't drive a regular car the whole way due to river
		crossings)
		<br /><strong><em>- or -</em></strong>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>Hire a 4x4 at the airport, drive the whole way</h5>
		If you're experienced at 4x4 driving on rugged terrain, and are confident
		with deep river crossings, you can hire a bigger car and drive the whole way
		to B√°sar yourself. There's one significant river crossing, to a depth of
		around 1m (depending on the weather). Check with the rental company that
		it's suitable for F-roads, and that you can drive to B√°sar.
		<br /><strong><em>- or -</em></strong>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>Hire a 4x4 campervan</h5>
		See <a href="#accommodationAnchor">Accommodation</a> section - and solve
		your transport and accommodation at the same time! See above notes about 4x4
		rentals and the route.
	</li>
</ul>
<h4>Getting back</h4>
<p>
	Buses leave B√°sar in the afternoon, so if you're leaving Iceland on the
	Sunday, book your flights from Keflavik no earlier than 9pm to leave enough
	time for the return bus trip.
</p>
<br />

<h4>
	We may also be chartering / hiring buses to make the journey more
	straightforward (and fun!).
</h4>
<p>
	We realise that we're bringing you all to a place that's quite a trek to get
	to, but it's all part of a plan to trap you all for three days so we can hang
	out properly!
</p>
<br />
<br />

<p>
	<em>
		√û√≥rsm√∂rk does technically have its own airport (<a
			href="https://www.greatcirclemapper.net/en/airport/BITM-thorsmoerk-airport.html"
			target="_blank"
			>BITM</a
		>), but you might struggle to find people to fly you there, and most
		importantly there is no duty-free, passport control, baggage handling staff
		or buildings, so we recommend Keflavik to be on the safe side.

<h4>
	√û√≥rsm√∂rk is the finishing point for two of Iceland's most popular hikes,
	Laugavegur (3-4 days) and Fimmv√∂r√∞uh√°ls (1 day).
</h4>

<p>
	So if you want to be super adventurous, you'd arrive in Reykjavik, and then
	book travel to either Landmannalaugar (hot springs and pink mountains) for the
	3-4 day Laugavegur hike, or Sk√≥gafoss (big-ass waterfall) for the 1 day
	Fimmv√∂r√∞uh√°ls hike.

	You can travel by sea from Europe to Iceland! This is probably only worthwhile
	if you're bringing your own van and are planning a longer stay in Iceland -
	it's not a luxury option by any means, and can get pretty expensive. Also the
	North Sea is not smooth sailing.
</h4>
<br />
<p>
	The Smyril Line ferry travels from Hirtshals in Denmark to beautiful
	Sey√∞isfj√∂r√∞ur on the East coast of Iceland, taking 2-3 days, depending on the
	schedule (<a
		href="https://booking.smyrilline.fo/en/book/return/journeySearch/"
		target="_blank"
		>link</a
	>)
</p>

<p>
	Once you land in Iceland, you'll then need to drive yourself to Seljalandsfoss
	(we'd recomend taking at least two days to do this, there's plenty to see on
	the way), and then either transfer to a bus going to √û√≥rsm√∂rk B√°sar (you can't
	drive a regular car or van the whole way due to river crossings), or hire a
	4x4 to drive the whole way if you're confident (see above).
	<br />
	There are buses going that way, if you want to keep things public transport
	all the way, from Egilssta√∞ir - see
	<a href="https://straeto.is/en" target="_blank"
		>Straeto (Icelandic public bus system)</a
	>
</p>

<p>
	If you're taking the ferry away from Iceland, you can take the 'north way
	around' via Akureyri back to Sey√∞isfj√∂r√∞ur, for which we'd recommend spending
	at least 2-3 days.

	They have exactly what you'd want after a day or four living out of a backpack
	and sleeping in a tent. Hot showers, electricity, 4G signal, toilets, a small
	shop and even a bar.
</p>

<p>
	The shop sells hot dogs, grilled sandwiches, snacks and a limited amount of
	spare camping bits.
</p>
<p>
	You won't be able to buy a new sleeping bag there, but they may sell you a
	pair of thick woolly socks when you discover that your H&M ankle socks aren't
	quite cutting it.
</p>

<h4>
	As you can see from the photos, it's bunk-bed style sleeping, and you'll need
	to bring your own bedding (a sleeping bag or duvet / bedcovers).
</h4>
<br />

<p>
	The cabins are both very warm and cosy, have power points, toilets, showers
	(with underfloor heating!) and kitchen which you'll have full acess to
	regardless of whether you're staying there or not.
</p>

<p>
	As we won't be able to fit all our guests in the cabins, we're giving priority
	to those coming from abroad. Please let us know when you RSVP which type of
	accommodation you're most likely to want to use.
</p>

<h5>
	We're getting a special deal on the cabins, two nights for 10,000 ISK per
	person.

<p>
	If you're an experienced off-road driver, and comfortable with river crossings
	(there's several, with the largest around 1m deep and 20m wide), you can rent
	a 4x4 campervan from places like
	<a href="https://www.campervanreykjavik.com/4x4-camper-rental" target="_blank"
		>Campervan Reykjavik</a
	>.
</p>
<p>
	You'll need one that's approved for use on F-roads, just ask if it's suitable
	to take to B√°sar, and has high enough clearance for the river crossings.
</p>

<p>
	Note that if there's been heavy rain, the river might be higher than usual,
	and you may have to take a bus - but we'll be travelling there ahead of time,
	so can let everyone know what the state of the road is. You can also check the
	<a href="https://umferdin.is/en/road/913110023">status</a> of the road online.

<h4>
	Tents are the simplest option, and camping in the woods at √û√≥rsm√∂rk is a great
	experience.
</h4>
<p>
	You can find a nice secluded spot in the forest next to a river (to keep the
	beer cool), or camp in one of the large, open spaces with benches and public
	grills. The area is large, but easy to navigate.

<p>
	Meaning you can absolutely dress up - the more fabulous or outrageous the
	better for our part - but bear in mind that it may get a little cold.
</p>

<h4>Key items to have with you are:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>fleece or wool jumper</li>
	<li>thermal underwear</li>
	<li>thick socks</li>
	<li>gloves and hats</li>
	<li>something to wear if it rains</li>
</ul>

<p>
	So ditch the high heels in favour of a nice pair of boots or comfortable
	shoes, and Gore-Tex beats Brogues any day of the week. Hiking shoes or sturdy
	trainers are even better as we'll be going for a short walk up the mountain
	post-ceremony to take photos.
</p>
<p>
	A suit, however, is still a suit if you're wearing a layer of thermals
	underneath (that's what Owen'll be wearing), and woollen jumpers with tights
	are a timeless Icelandic wedding look.
</p>

<p>
	The key to dressing for Iceland is layers - take them off when the sun comes
	out and you're sunbathing on a grassy hill, put them on when it starts
	hailing. No joke, we've had both of these things within the space of 4 hours,
	in B√°sar, at this time of year.
</p>

                <header>What To Bring - Gifts</header>
                
<h3>You showing up and partying with us is the best gift we can ask for.</h3>
<p>We have a small apartment, that's recently been fixed up.</p>
<p>
	We don't need any material presents, and honestly don't have the space for any
	of them either!
</p>
<h4>
	But if you really want to give us something, we'd love for people to get
	involved with the weekend.
</h4>
<p>
	We both find it fun to get involved with events and having a task to do, so if
	you want to contribute to making this a little camping festival, that would be
	fantastic - and we should be able to find a task for anyone coming over, just
	get in touch.
</p>
<p>
	For example, we have very talented friends and family members, and there will
	be an ‚Äòopen-mic' on the Friday night where guests can perform a song, or a
	cabaret or circus act or lead guests in a group game. On the Saturday there's
	free time early in the day if anyone would want to lead a yoga or dance class,
	or even a writing workshop - and there's also space for speeches before
	dancing takes over.
</p>
<p>
	And if you don't feel like contributing in an artistic way, we might ask you
	to shop for us in the duty-free on your way over, help with signage or
	decoration, or find you a task you'd be happy with.
</p>

                <header>What to bring - Sleeping Stuff</header>
                
<p>
	A 3-season sleeping bag, pillow and an inflatable camping mattress is all you
	need, even if you're in a tent - again, think Glastonbury.
</p>

<img src="../images/what-to-wear/bed.jpg" class="floatLeft triple" />
<p>
	This also applies if you're staying in the hut (minus the mattress), but a
	light duvet and bedding also works.
</p>
<p>
	Also bearing in mind this is August in Iceland - you will get a maximum of two
	hours 'darkness', even inside the cabin. For some people that's an issue, and
	they find they'll need a sleep mask in order to nod off. Although we're
	confident that the mountain air and partying should ensure that falling asleep
	at the end of the day won't be a problem!
</p>

            </article><article id="kids" class="whatToBring">
                <header>Kids</header>
                
<p>
	As much as we love your kids, we're hoping to spend this time with you! We're
	therefore asking if it's possible to find a way for you to be kid-free at the
	weekend, so you can enjoy the weekend to the fullest!
</p>

<p>
	We also do understand that many of you are travelling from abroad (some from
	very far), so it's not possible to leave your kids behind.
</p>

<p>
	In that case, please message us - B√°sar is a large campground and popular with
	families, and √û√≥rsm√∂rk (well, Iceland in general) is a great environment for
	kids with wide open spaces and no dangerous plants or animals. The nature
	however can be a little tricky (fast, deep, cold rivers and steep rock faces)
	so it's good to be prepared.
