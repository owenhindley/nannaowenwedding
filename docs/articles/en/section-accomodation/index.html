        Being a stunningly remote location in the Highlands, there are
        no 5-star hotels nearby. You'll have three main options for
        accomodation - a bed in the cabin, a campervan, or bringing
        your own tent.

        <h3>The Cabins</h3>
        <p>
            Basar has two large wooden cabins, and sleeps 75 friendly
            people across two floors each.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see from the photos, it's bunk-bed style
            sleeping, and you'll need to bring your own bedding (a
            sleeping bag or duvet / bedcovers). The cabins are both
            very warm and cosy, have power points, toilets, showers
            (with underfloor heating!) and kitchen which you'll have
            full acess to regardless of whether you're staying there
            or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're getting a special deal on the cabins, two nights for
            10,000 ISK per person.

        <h3>Campervans</h3>
        <p>
            If you're an experienced off-road driver, and comfortable
            with river crossings (there's several, with the largest
            around 1m deep and 20m wide), you can rent a 4x4 campervan
            from (link).
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that if there's been heavy rain, the river might be
            higher than usual, and you may have to take a bus - but
            we'll be travelling there ahead of time, so can let
            everyone know what the state of the road is.
        </p>

        <p>
            The campsite charges 2000 ISK per person per night for
            campervans.

        <h3>Tents</h3>
        <p>
            Tents are the simplest option, and camping in the woods at
            Þórsmörk is a great experience. You can find a nice
            secluded spot in the forest next to a river (to keep the
            beer cool), or camp in one of the large, open spaces with
            benches and public grills. The area is large, but easy to
            navigate.
