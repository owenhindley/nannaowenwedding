    Þórsmörk is the finishing point for two of Iceland's most popular
    hikes, Laugavegur (3-4 days) and Fimmvörðuháls (1 day).

        first trip to Iceland, which is the main reason why we wanted

    Some of you have already expressed an interest in hiking to the
    venue - and we can transport anything you don't need for the hike
    directly to the venue (like your tents, if you stay in the huts
    along the way).
</p>
<p>
    Just message us if you're interested, and we'll tell you all you
    need to know, as well as connecting you with other people who want
    to do the same.
