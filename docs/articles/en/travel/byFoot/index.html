    Þórsmörk is the finishing point for two of Iceland's most popular
    hikes, Laugavegur (3-4 days) and Fimmvörðuháls (1 day).

    <em>Owen walked Fimmvörðuháls with Nanna on his very
        first trip to Iceland, which is the main reason why we wanted
        to hold the wedding here.</em

    So if you want to be super adventurous, you'd arrive in Reykjavik, and then book travel to either Landmannalaugar (hot springs and pink mountains) for the 3-4 day Laugavegur hike, or Skogarfoss (big-ass waterfall) for the 1 day Fimmvörðuháls hike.

    Some of you have already expressed an interest in hiking to the
    venue - and we can transport anything you don't need for the hike
    directly to the venue (like your tents, if you stay in the huts
    along the way).
</p>
<h4>
    Just message us if you're interested, and we'll tell you all you
    need to know, as well as connecting you with other people who want
    to do the same.
