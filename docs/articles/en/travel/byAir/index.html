    If you don't already live in Iceland, it's very likely you'll need
    to book a ticket on a plane to get to our wedding.

<h5>(because Iceland is surrounded by sea and
    quite a long way away from anything else.)</h5>

<p>
    Keflavik is a small, cosy airport, with a very well stocked
    duty-free (see Food & Drinks). If you look out of the right window
    when you're coming in from Europe, you might just see the latest
    volcano smoking away.</p>
    <p> There's also an airport in Reykjavik City, but that's only
    for domestic trips.
</p>

<h4>From Keflavik Airport your options are:</h4>
<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h5>Take a transfer bus to Reykjavik</h5> 
        (45 minutes - we reccomend FlyBus)
        Depending on when you arrive, spend some time
        there before taking another bus to Þórsmörk Básar (options for
        public buses)
        <br/><strong><em>- or -</em></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Hire a small car at the airport</h5> 
        Go for a sightseeing drive, park the car near Seljalandsfoss and
        take a bus to Þórsmörk Básar (you can't drive a regular car
        the whole way due to river crossings)
        <br/><strong><em>- or -</em></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Hire a 4x4 car at the airport</h5>
        If you're experienced at 4x4 driving on rugged terrain, and are
        confident with deep river crossings, you can hire a bigger car
        and drive the whole way to Básar yourself. There's one
        significant river crossing, to a depth of around 1m (depending
        on the weather). Check with the rental company that it's suitable for F-roads, and that you can drive to Básar.
        <br/><strong><em>- or -</em></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Hire a 4x4 campervan</h5>
        See Accommodation section - and solve your transport and accommodation at the same time! See above notes about 4x4 rentals and the route. 
    </li>
</ul>

    We're going to try and get some discounts for you all with local hire companies - we'll keep this page updated if we do. We may also be chartering / hiring buses to make the journey more
    straightforward (and fun!).

<p><em>
    Þósmörk does technically have its own airport (<a
        href="https://www.greatcirclemapper.net/en/airport/BITM-thorsmoerk-airport.html"
        target="_blank"
        >BITM</a
    >), but you might struggle to find people to fly you there, and
    most importantly there is no duty-free on arrival (or
    buildings of any kind), so we recommend Keflavik to be on the safe side.
