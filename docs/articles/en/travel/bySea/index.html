    You can travel by sea from Europe to Iceland - the Smyril Line
    ferry travels from Hirtshals in Denmark to beautiful Seyðisfjörður
    on the East coast of Iceland, taking 2-3 days, depending on the
    schedule (<a

</p>

<p>
    It's a car ferry, so it's ideal if you're looking to make a bigger
    trip with a campervan or your own car. The ferry also stops off at
    the Faroe Islands along the way.

<p>
    Once you land in Iceland, you'll then need to drive yourself to
    Seljalandsfoss (we'd reccomend taking at least two days to do
    this, there's plenty to see on the way), and then either transfer
    to a bus going to Þórsmörk Básar (you can't drive a regular car or
    van the whole way due to river crossings), or hire a 4x4 to drive
    the whole way if you're confident (see above).
</p>
<p>
    There are public buses going that way, if you're feeling
    adventurous, from Egilsstaðir - see

<p>
    If you're taking the ferry away from Iceland, you can take the
    'north way around' via Akureyri back to Seyðisfjörður, for which
    we'd reccommend spending at least 2-3 days.
