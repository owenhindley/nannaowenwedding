<h4>
	You can travel by sea from Europe to Iceland! This is probably only worthwhile
	if you're bringing your own van and are planning a longer stay in Iceland -
	it's not a luxury option by any means, and can get pretty expensive. Also the
	North Sea is not smooth sailing.

<p>
	The Smyril Line ferry travels from Hirtshals in Denmark to beautiful
	Seyðisfjörður on the East coast of Iceland, taking 2-3 days, depending on the
	schedule (<a

	>)
</p>

<p>
	Once you land in Iceland, you'll then need to drive yourself to Seljalandsfoss
	(we'd recomend taking at least two days to do this, there's plenty to see on
	the way), and then either transfer to a bus going to Þórsmörk Básar (you can't
	drive a regular car or van the whole way due to river crossings), or hire a
	4x4 to drive the whole way if you're confident (see above).
	<br />
	There are buses going that way, if you want to keep things public transport
	all the way, from Egilsstaðir - see

	>
</p>

<p>
	If you're taking the ferry away from Iceland, you can take the 'north way
	around' via Akureyri back to Seyðisfjörður, for which we'd recommend spending
	at least 2-3 days.
