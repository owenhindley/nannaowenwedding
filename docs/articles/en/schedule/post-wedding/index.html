	We'll stay on at the campsite until at least Monday - you are all absolutely
	welcome to stay with us a bit longer if you wish! There's plenty of short
	hikes you can do from there, and lots to explore.
</p>

<p>
	Please bear in mind that there are very limited food facilities at the
	campsite, and you will need to book extra nights in the cabin, or pay for
	additional tent / campervan fees if you are planning on staying longer.

	Once we return to Reykjav√≠k, we'd love to hang out with you all in town, as
	we're not planning on going away on honeymoon straight away (at the moment).
