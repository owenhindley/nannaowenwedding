	We'll be at the campsite from at least Thursday beforehand, but more likely
	Wednesday or even Tuesday in order to get everything ready. If you would like
	to join us (and maybe even help getting things set up), we would absolutely
	love you to.

<p>Just please bear in mind the limited food options available!</p>
