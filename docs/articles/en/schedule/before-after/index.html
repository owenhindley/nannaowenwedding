	Before &amp after the wedding, you'll be in one of the most popular regions of
	Iceland for things to do and see - the South Coast.
</p>
<p>
	You can get an overview of tours or places to go and check out
	<a href="https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/south-coast">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	There's a hostel / tour base camp nearby called
	<a href="https://midgardbasecamp.is/">Midgard</a> who are also fantastic. You
	can stay there and also book things like glacier hiking, horse riding,
	snowmobiling, ice cave trips with them directly. As we mentioned above, - you
	can book directly with them <a href="mailto:sleep@midgard.is">by email</a>,
	and by mentioning "Nanna & Owen's Wedding" you should get a reduced rate on
	rooms.
