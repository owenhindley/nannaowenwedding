	A 3-season sleeping bag, pillow and an inflatable camping mattress is all you
	need, even if you're in a tent - again, think Glastonbury.

	This also applies if you're staying in the hut (minus the mattress), but a
	light duvet and bedding also works.

	Also bearing in mind this is August in Iceland - you will get a maximum of two
	hours 'darkness', even inside the cabin. For some people that's an issue, and
	they find they'll need a sleep mask in order to nod off. Although we're
	confident that the mountain air and partying should ensure that falling asleep
	at the end of the day won't be a problem!
