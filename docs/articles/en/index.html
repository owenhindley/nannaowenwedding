<header>About Us</header>
<img class="floatLeft" src="images/about-us/engagement-0.jpg" />

<h3>
	Chances are, if you're reading this, you already know us (or at least one of
	us).
</h3>
<h5>* But here's a little recap of our story.</h5>
<p>
	Nanna moved to London from Reykjavík in 2009 to study European theatre. Owen
	moved to London in 2010 from Guildford to start work for Metropolis recording
	studio. At Metropolis he got to know his first Icelander, Ragnar, and he
	subsequently moved in with Ragnar and all his badgers. Coincidentally, Owen
	and Ragnar share the same birthday.
</p>
<p>
	Nanna studied with another Icelander, Brynja, who started dating Ragnar - whom
	Nanna had put dibs on. (Brynja and Ragnar are still together and now have a
	baby).
</p>
<p>
	In 2012, around the time that Owen and Ragnar had a birthday, they had a film
	night at their place, and Brynja brought Nanna along to it. Nanna flirted the
	entire evening with Owen, who took no notice of it.
</p>
<p>
	A couple of months later, Owen was dragged along to an Icelandic Eurovision
	party in a pub in west London, meeting Nanna a second time, this time partying
	with Iceland's craziest Eurovision fan, her sister Tinna. After a long night
	of searching for a party in the city that falls asleep at 11pm, Owen and Nanna
	got to crash at the sofa at Tinna's place (after an encounter with an armed
	police officer).
</p>
<p>
	As they walked away the next day, Tinna remarked that they had a “hjónasvipur”
	(Icelandic word for “looking like they'll get hitched”). This was shortly
	before Nanna graduated, and intended to leave London. A week later they went
	on their first “date” - at a one day music festival in London, and a month
	later Owen came to Iceland for the first time, hiking the Fimmvörðuháls hike
	to Þórsmörk.
</p>
<p>
	At Edinburgh Fringe festival they had the “couple talk”, immediately followed
	by Nanna asking to live with Owen for a short 2 month stint before travelling
	to Brazil and Argentina.
</p>
<h5>- Next 10 years in short: -</h5>
<p>
	Nanna managed to get Owen to travel around the world for fun, and Owen managed
	to get Nanna to stick around in London for 4 more years and learn to drink
	tea. They have both spent 7 years of their lives in London, and have now spent
	7 years living together in Iceland. When they moved to Iceland they founded a
	theatre company together, Huldufugl, which has enabled them to create projects
	together and perform around the world, working with projects as diverse as
	circus, virtual reality, ABBA and Fringe festivals.
</p>
<p>
	After spending a decade together, they got married in a small ceremony in
	Reykjavík on Nanna's parents wedding anniversary date, 11.11.22.
</p>

<h3>
	However, now it's time to have the big party with friends we've gathered in
	one place from around the world, people we've met on various travels and
	adventures.
</h3>
<p>
	This weekend will be coloured by our many travels and experiences, mixing
	Icelandic, British and Brazilian culture, and even with a dash of Indian
	culture. We can't wait for our British, Icelandic, Brazilian, Indian,
	Australian, American, African and all over European friends to meet each
	other, surrounded by the impressive Þórsmörk natural beauty!
</p>

<h3>
	Þórsmörk is a valley in South Iceland - <br />
	bordered on one side by Eyjafjallajökull <br />(yep, that volcano from
	2010)<br />
	and the Icelandic highlands on the other.
</h3>

<img class="floatLeft" src="images/location/basar-1.jpg" />

<p>
	The campground / cabin area in Þórsmörk we'll be in is called Básar, the
	largest and best-equipped in the valley. It's also the most accessible, as you
	don't have to cross the main river (Krossá) to get there.
</p>
<p>
	It's surrounded by dramatic rocky outcrops, cosy forests, tiny glacial streams
	and woody paths winding up to epic mountainside meadows where you might just
	catch sight of an arctic fox - or find some wild blueberries to snack on.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>
	In one direction you can see glaciers, or the red-orange mountains towards
	Landmannalaugar, in the other direction you can almost see to the coast and
	the North Sea.
</p>

<h4>
	It's one of the most beautiful places in all of Iceland, and we're excited to
	transform this stunning, rustic place into our own little festival for you
	all, with soundsystem, lights and live music. (And if you want to perform too,
	that's great!)
</h4>

<br />

            </article><article id="section-weather" class="location">
                <header>The Weather</header>
                
<h3>
	There's a saying in Iceland: "If you don't like the weather, just wait 5
	minutes".
</h3>
<p>
	There's another saying: "There's no such thing as bad weather, just being
	poorly dressed".
</p>
<img src="images/weather/weather-1.jpg" class="floatRight small" />

<p>
	Although Þórsmörk is famed for having more pleasant weather than its
	surrounding area, due to the fact that the area is circled by mountains that
	keep most of the wind at bay, there is still a high chance of unpleasant
	weather.
</p>
<p>
	This may come in the form of rain, wind or even snow/hail. If we're lucky,
	there'll be pleasant sunshine throughout the weekend, but you'd be wise to
	prepare for the worst but hope for the best. Also note that the area is in a
	green birch area, right next to a glacier and a volcano, so contrasts can be
	extreme in both landscape and weather.
</p>
<img src="images/what-to-wear/volcano.jpg" class="floatLeft small" />
<p>
	Temperature may range from anything between 5°C-25°C, but one thing is for
	certain -
	<strong
		>there will be daylight until close to midnight, and darkness will only last
		for about 2-3 hours.</strong
	>
