        <h3>By Air</h3>
        <p>
            If you don't already live in Iceland, it's very likely
            you'll need to book a ticket on a plane to get from where
            you currently live to our wedding, on account of it being
            surrounded by sea, and quite a long way away from anything
            else.
        </p>

        <p>
            Þósmörk does technically have its own airport (BITM -
            link), but you might struggle to find people to fly you
            there, and most importantly there is no duty-free on
            arrival (or actual buildings of any kind), so we recommend
            Keflavik International Airport (KEF) to be on the safe
            side.
        </p>

        <p>
            Keflavik is a small, cosy airport, with a very well
            stocked duty-free (see Food & Drinks). If you look out of
            the right window when you're coming in from Europe, you
            might just see the latest volcano smoking away (if you're
            coming from the US, you're out of luck). There's also an
            airport in Reykjavik City, but that's only for domestic
            trips (with some exceptions).
        </p>

        <p>From Keflavik Airport your options are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Take a transfer bus to Reykjavik (45 minutes - we
                reccomend FlyBus), and depending on when you arrive,
                spend some time there before taking another bus to
                Þórsmörk Básar (options for public buses)
            </li>
            <li>
                Hire a regular car at the airport (recommendations),
                go for a sightseeing drive, and park the car near
                Seljalandsfoss and take a bus to Þórsmörk Básar (you
                can't drive a regular car the whole way due to river
                crossings)
            </li>
            <li>
                If you're experienced at 4x4 off-road driving, and are
                confident driving through rivers, you can hire a
                bigger car (ideally one with a periscope) and drive
                the whole way to Básar yourself. There's one
                significant river crossing, to a depth of around 1m
                (depending on the weather). There's also 4x4
                campervans available from (link).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We may be chartering / hiring buses to make the journey
            more straightforward (and fun!), we'll post more about
            this soon.
