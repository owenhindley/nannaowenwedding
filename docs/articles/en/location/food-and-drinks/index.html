<p>We will be serving the following meals:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Friday night</li>
    <li>Saturday breakfast</li>
    <li>Saturday lunch / high tea</li>
    <li>Saturday evening meal + Churrasco</li>
    <li>Sunday leftover brunch</li>
</ul>

<p>
    There are several outdoor grilling areas where you can cook extra
    bits if you feel the need, and a kitchen with several hotplates in
    the main hut. However from Friday-Sunday morning these will likely
    be in use for preparing the main wedding feast, so if you're
    planning on being with us earlier than Friday afternoon or later
    than Sunday (which will be great!), consider bringing your own gas
    stove or things that can be thrown on the barbeque (bring your own
    coals).

    We'll be providing enough beer and wine for everybody, and maybe
    even a

    >. You are, of course, welcome to bring your own (the glacial
    rivers that run through the campsite make excellent beer fridges),
    but you shouldn't need to in order to maintain a full glass or
    beer in hand at all times.
