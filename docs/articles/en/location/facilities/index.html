    BÃ¡sar is the start and end point for two of the most popular hikes
    in Iceland. So they have exactly what you'd want after a day or
    four living out of a backpack and sleeping in a tent. Hot showers,
    electricity, 4G signal, toilets (with toilet paper), a small shop
    and even a bar. The shop sells hot dogs, grilled sandwiches,
    snacks and a limited amount of spare camping bits.

    You won't be able to buy a new sleeping bag there, but they may
    sell you a pair of thick woolly socks when you discover that your
    H&M ankle socks aren't quite cutting it.
