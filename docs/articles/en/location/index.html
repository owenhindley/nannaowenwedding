<h3>
	Þórsmörk is a valley in South Iceland - <br />
	bordered on one side by Eyjafjallajökull <br />(yep, that volcano from
	2010)<br />
	and the Icelandic highlands on the other.
</h3>

<p>
	The campground / cabin area in Þórsmörk we'll be in is called Básar, the
	largest and best-equipped in the valley. It's also the most accessible, as you
	don't have to cross the main river (Krossá) to get there.
</p>
<p>
	It's surrounded by dramatic rocky outcrops, cosy forests, tiny glacial streams
	and woody paths winding up to epic mountainside meadows where you might just
	catch sight of an arctic fox - or find some wild blueberries to snack on.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>
	In one direction you can see glaciers, or the red-orange mountains towards
	Landmannalaugar, in the other direction you can almost see to the coast and
	the North Sea.
</p>

<h4>
	It's one of the most beautiful places in all of Iceland, and we're excited to
	transform this stunning, rustic place into our own little festival for you
	all, with soundsystem, lights and live music. (And if you want to perform too,
	that's great!)
