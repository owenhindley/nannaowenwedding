        Þórsmörk is a region and valley in South Iceland, bordered on
        one side by Eyjafjallajökull (yep, that volcano from 2010),
        and the Icelandic highlands on the other. It's got a great big
        river running through the middle (Krossá), which gets fed by
        smaller rivers coming down off the glacier, some of which pass
        straight through the road.

        The campground / cabin area in Þórsmörk we'll be in is called
        Básar, the largest and best-equipped in the valley. It's
        surrounded by dramatic rocky outcrops, cosy forests, tiny
        glacial streams and woody paths winding up to epic
        mountainside meadows where you might just catch sight of an
        arctic fox - or find some wild blueberries to snack on. In one
        direction you can see glaciers, or the red-orange mountains in
        Landmannalaugar, in the other direction you can almost see to
        the coast and the North Sea.

        It's one of the most beautiful places in all of Iceland, and
        we're excited to welcome you all!
