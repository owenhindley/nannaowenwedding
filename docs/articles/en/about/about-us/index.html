    <h3>Chances are, if you're reading this, you already know us (or at least one of us).</h3>
    <h5> * But here's a little recap of our story.</h5>
    <p>
    Nanna moved to London from Reykjavík in 2009 to study European theatre. Owen moved to London in 2010 from Guildford to start work for Metropolis recording studio. At Metropolis he got to know his first Icelander, Ragnar, and he subsequently moved in with Ragnar and all his badgers. Coincidentally, Owen and Ragnar share the same birthday.</p>
    <p>Nanna studied with another Icelander, Brynja, who started dating Ragnar - whom Nanna had put dibs on. (Brynja and Ragnar are still together and now have a baby).</p>
<p> In 2012, around the time that Owen and Ragnar had a birthday, they had a film night at their place, and Brynja brought Nanna along to it. Nanna flirted the entire evening with Owen, who took no notice of it.</p>
<p>A couple of months later, Owen was dragged along to an Icelandic Eurovision party in a pub in west London, meeting Nanna a second time, this time partying with Iceland's craziest Eurovision fan, her sister Tinna. After a long night of searching for a party in the city that falls asleep at 11pm, Owen and Nanna got to crash at the sofa at Tinna's place (after an encounter with an armed police officer).</p>
<p> As they walked away the next day, Tinna remarked that they had a “hjónasvipur” (Icelandic word for “looking like they'll get hitched”). This was shortly before Nanna graduated, and intended to leave London. A week later they went on their first “date” - at a one day music festival in London, and a month later Owen came to Iceland for the first time, hiking the Fimmvörðuháls hike to Þórsmörk.</p>
<p>At Edinburgh Fringe festival they had the “couple talk”, immediately followed by Nanna asking to live with Owen for a short 2 month stint before travelling to Brazil and Argentina.</p>
   <h5>- Next 10 years in short: -</h5>
    <p>Nanna managed to get Owen to travel around the world for fun, and Owen managed to get Nanna to stick around in London for 4 more years and learn to drink tea. They have both spent 7 years of their lives in London, and have now spent 7 years living together in Iceland. When they moved to Iceland they founded a theatre company together, Huldufugl, which has enabled them to create projects together and perform around the world, working with projects as diverse as circus, virtual reality, ABBA and Fringe festivals.</p>
<p>After spending a decade together, they got married in a small ceremony in Reykjavík on Nanna's parents wedding anniversary date, 11.11.22. </p>
    
  <h3>However, now it's time to have the big party with friends we've gathered in one place from around the world, people we've met on various travels and adventures.</h3>
     <p>This weekend will be coloured by our many travels and experiences, mixing Icelandic, British and Brazilian culture, and even with a dash of Indian culture. We can't wait for our British, Icelandic, Brazilian, Indian, Australian, American, African and all over European friends to meet each other, surrounded by the impressive Þórsmörk natural beauty!
