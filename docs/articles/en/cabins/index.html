<h3>The Cabins</h3>
<p>
    Basar has two large wooden cabins, and sleeps 75 friendly people
    across two floors each.
</p>
<p>
    As you can see from the photos, it's bunk-bed style sleeping, and
    you'll need to bring your own bedding (a sleeping bag or duvet /
    bedcovers). The cabins are both very warm and cosy, have power
    points, toilets, showers (with underfloor heating!) and kitchen
    which you'll have full acess to regardless of whether you're
    staying there or not.

    We're getting a special deal on the cabins, two nights for 10,000
    ISK per person.
