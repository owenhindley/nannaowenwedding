<p>
	Being a stunningly remote location in the Highlands, there are no 5-star
	hotels nearby. You'll have three main options for accommodation - a bed in one
	of the two cabins, a campervan, or bringing your own tent.

<h4>
	We've booked out both cabins for the entire weekend, so you'll have access to
	everything mentioned below, even if you're not sleeping there.
