<p>
	If you're an experienced off-road driver, and comfortable with river crossings
	(there's several, with the largest around 1m deep and 20m wide), you can rent
	a 4x4 campervan from places like
	<a href="https://www.campervanreykjavik.com/4x4-camper-rental" target="_blank"
		>Campervan Reykjavik</a
	>.
</p>
<p>
	You'll need one that's approved for use on F-roads, just ask if it's suitable
	to take to BÃ¡sar, and has high enough clearance for the river crossings.
</p>

<p>
	Note that if there's been heavy rain, the river might be higher than usual,
	and you may have to take a bus - but we'll be travelling there ahead of time,
	so can let everyone know what the state of the road is. You can also check the
	<a href="https://umferdin.is/en/road/913110023">status</a> of the road online.

<h5>The campsite charges 2000 ISK per person per night for campervans.</h5>
