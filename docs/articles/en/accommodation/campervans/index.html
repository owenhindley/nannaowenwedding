    If you're an experienced off-road driver, and comfortable with
    river crossings (there's several, with the largest around 1m deep
    and 20m wide), you can rent a 4x4 campervan from (link).

    Note that if there's been heavy rain, the river might be higher
    than usual, and you may have to take a bus - but we'll be
    travelling there ahead of time, so can let everyone know what the
    state of the road is.

    The campsite charges 2000 ISK per person per night for campervans.
