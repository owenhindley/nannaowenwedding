                <header>The Location</header>
                
<p>
    Þórsmörk is a region and valley in South Iceland, bordered on one
    side by Eyjafjallajökull (yep, that volcano from 2010), and the
    Icelandic highlands on the other. It's got a great big river
    running through the middle (Krossá), which gets fed by smaller
    rivers coming down off the glacier, some of which pass straight
    through the road.
</p>

<p>
    The campground / cabin area in Þórsmörk we'll be in is called
    Básar, the largest and best-equipped in the valley. It's
    surrounded by dramatic rocky outcrops, cosy forests, tiny glacial
    streams and woody paths winding up to epic mountainside meadows
    where you might just catch sight of an arctic fox - or find some
    wild blueberries to snack on. In one direction you can see
    glaciers, or the red-orange mountains in Landmannalaugar, in the
    other direction you can almost see to the coast and the North Sea.
</p>

<p>
    It's one of the most beautiful places in all of Iceland, and we're
    excited to welcome you all!
</p>

            </article><article id="section-facilities" class="location">
                <header>Facilities</header>
                
<p>
    Básar is the start and end point for two of the most popular hikes
    in Iceland. So they have exactly what you'd want after a day or
    four living out of a backpack and sleeping in a tent. Hot showers,
    electricity, 4G signal, toilets (with toilet paper), a small shop
    and even a bar. The shop sells hot dogs, grilled sandwiches,
    snacks and a limited amount of spare camping bits.
</p>
<p>
    You won't be able to buy a new sleeping bag there, but they may
    sell you a pair of thick woolly socks when you discover that your
    H&M ankle socks aren't quite cutting it.
</p>

            </article><article id="section-foodDrink" class="location">
                <header>Food &amp; Drink</header>
                
<p>We will be serving the following meals:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Friday night</li>
    <li>Saturday breakfast</li>
    <li>Saturday lunch / high tea</li>
    <li>Saturday evening meal + Churrasco</li>
    <li>Sunday leftover brunch</li>
</ul>

<p>
    There are several outdoor grilling areas where you can cook extra
    bits if you feel the need, and a kitchen with several hotplates in
    the main hut. However from Friday-Sunday morning these will likely
    be in use for preparing the main wedding feast, so if you're
    planning on being with us earlier than Friday afternoon or later
    than Sunday (which will be great!), consider bringing your own gas
    stove or things that can be thrown on the barbeque (bring your own
    coals).
</p>

<p>
    We'll be providing enough beer and wine for everybody, and maybe
    even a
    <a
        href="https://svantana.bandcamp.com/track/you-were-workin-as-a-waitress-in-a-cocktail-bar"
        target="_blank"
        >cocktail bar</a
    >. You are, of course, welcome to bring your own (the glacial
    rivers that run through the campsite make excellent beer fridges),
    but you shouldn't need to in order to maintain a full glass or
    beer in hand at all times.
</p>

        <section><article id="section-byAir" class="travel">
                <header>By Air</header>
                
<p>
    If you don't already live in Iceland, it's very likely you'll need
    to book a ticket on a plane to get from where you currently live
    to our wedding, on account of it being surrounded by sea, and
    quite a long way away from anything else.
</p>

<p>
    Þósmörk does technically have its own airport (<a
        href="https://www.greatcirclemapper.net/en/airport/BITM-thorsmoerk-airport.html"
        target="_blank"
        >BITM</a
    >), but you might struggle to find people to fly you there, and
    most importantly there is no duty-free on arrival (or actual
    buildings of any kind), so we recommend Keflavik International
    Airport (KEF) to be on the safe side.
</p>

<p>
    Keflavik is a small, cosy airport, with a very well stocked
    duty-free (see Food & Drinks). If you look out of the right window
    when you're coming in from Europe, you might just see the latest
    volcano smoking away (if you're coming from the US, you're out of
    luck). There's also an airport in Reykjavik City, but that's only
    for domestic trips (with some exceptions).
</p>

<p>From Keflavik Airport your options are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Take a transfer bus to Reykjavik (45 minutes - we reccomend
        FlyBus), and depending on when you arrive, spend some time
        there before taking another bus to Þórsmörk Básar (options for
        public buses)
        <br/><em>- or -</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        Hire a regular car at the airport (recommendations), go for a
        sightseeing drive, and park the car near Seljalandsfoss and
        take a bus to Þórsmörk Básar (you can't drive a regular car
        the whole way due to river crossings)
        <br/><em>- or -</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        If you're experienced at 4x4 off-road driving, and are
        confident driving through rivers, you can hire a bigger car
        and drive the whole way to Básar yourself. There's one
        significant river crossing, to a depth of around 1m (depending
        on the weather). There's also 4x4 campervans available from
        (link).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We may be chartering / hiring buses to make the journey more
    straightforward (and fun!), we'll post more about this soon.
</p>

                <header>By Foot</header>
                
<p>
    Þórsmörk is the finishing point for two of Iceland's most popular
    hikes, Laugavegur (3-4 days) and Fimmvörðuháls (1 day).
</p>
<p>
    <em
        >Actually, Owen walked Fimmvörðuháls with Nanna on his very
        first trip to Iceland, which is the main reason why we wanted
        to hold the wedding here.</em
    >
</p>

<p>
    Some of you have already expressed an interest in hiking to the
    venue - and we can transport anything you don't need for the hike
    directly to the venue (like your tents, if you stay in the huts
    along the way).
</p>
<p>
    Just message us if you're interested, and we'll tell you all you
    need to know, as well as connecting you with other people who want
    to do the same.
</p>

            </article><article id="section-bySea" class="travel">
                <header>By Sea</header>
                
<p>
    You can travel by sea from Europe to Iceland - the Smyril Line
    ferry travels from Hirtshals in Denmark to beautiful Seyðisfjörður
    on the East coast of Iceland, taking 2-3 days, depending on the
    schedule (<a
        href="https://booking.smyrilline.fo/en/book/return/journeySearch/"
        target="_blank"
        >link</a
    >)
</p>

<p>
    It's a car ferry, so it's ideal if you're looking to make a bigger
    trip with a campervan or your own car. The ferry also stops off at
    the Faroe Islands along the way.
</p>

<p>
    Once you land in Iceland, you'll then need to drive yourself to
    Seljalandsfoss (we'd reccomend taking at least two days to do
    this, there's plenty to see on the way), and then either transfer
    to a bus going to Þórsmörk Básar (you can't drive a regular car or
    van the whole way due to river crossings), or hire a 4x4 to drive
    the whole way if you're confident (see above).
</p>
<p>
    There are public buses going that way, if you're feeling
    adventurous, from Egilsstaðir - see
    <a href="https://straeto.is/en" target="_blank"
        >Straeto (Icelandic public bus system)</a
    >
</p>

<p>
    If you're taking the ferry away from Iceland, you can take the
    'north way around' via Akureyri back to Seyðisfjörður, for which
    we'd reccommend spending at least 2-3 days.
</p>

<p>
    Being a stunningly remote location in the Highlands, there are no
    5-star hotels nearby. You'll have three main options for
    accomodation - a bed in the cabin, a campervan, or bringing your
    own tent.
</p>

            </article><article id="article-the-cabins" class="accommodation">
                <header>The Cabins</header>
                
<p>
    Basar has two large wooden cabins, and sleeps 75 friendly people
    across two floors each.
</p>
<p>
    As you can see from the photos, it's bunk-bed style sleeping, and
    you'll need to bring your own bedding (a sleeping bag or duvet /
    bedcovers). The cabins are both very warm and cosy, have power
    points, toilets, showers (with underfloor heating!) and kitchen
    which you'll have full acess to regardless of whether you're
    staying there or not.
</p>
<p>
    We're getting a special deal on the cabins, two nights for 10,000
    ISK per person.
</p>

            </article><article id="article-campervans" class="accommodation">
                <header>Campervans</header>
                
<p>
    If you're an experienced off-road driver, and comfortable with
    river crossings (there's several, with the largest around 1m deep
    and 20m wide), you can rent a 4x4 campervan from (link).
</p>
<p>
    Note that if there's been heavy rain, the river might be higher
    than usual, and you may have to take a bus - but we'll be
    travelling there ahead of time, so can let everyone know what the
    state of the road is.
</p>

<p>
    The campsite charges 2000 ISK per person per night for campervans.
</p>

            </article><article id="section-tents" class="accommodation">
                <header>Tents</header>
                
<p>
    Tents are the simplest option, and camping in the woods at
    Þórsmörk is a great experience. You can find a nice secluded spot
    in the forest next to a river (to keep the beer cool), or camp in
    one of the large, open spaces with benches and public grills. The
    area is large, but easy to navigate.
</p>

<p>
    Dress code is : Imagine you're going to Glastonbury / Coachella in
    October in the UK.
</p>
<p>
    Meaning you can absolutely dress up - the more fabulous or
    outrageous the better for our part - but bear in mind that it may
    get a little cold when the sun goes down (between 23.00 and 00.00,
    after which it starts to come back up again)
</p>

<p>
    So ditch the high heels in favour of a nice pair of boots or
    comfortable shoes, and Gore-Tex beats Brogues any day of the week.
</p>

<p>
    A suit, however, is still a suit if you're wearing a layer of
    thermals underneath (that's what Owen'll be wearing), and woollen
    jumpers with tights are a timeless Icelandic wedding look.
</p>

<p>
    The key to dressing for Iceland is layers - take them off when the
    sun comes out and you're sunbathing on a grassy hill, put them on
    when it starts hailing. No joke, we've had both of these things
    within the space of 4 hours, in Básar, at this time of year.
</p>

            </article><article id="kids" class="whatToBring">
                <header>Kids</header>
                
<p>
    As much as we love your kids, we're hoping to spend this time with
    you! We're therefore asking if it's possible to find a way for you
    to be kid-free at the weekend, so you can enjoy the weekend to the
    fullest!
</p>

<p>
    We also do understand that many of you are travelling from abroad
    (some from very far), so it's not possible to leave your kids
    behind.
</p>

<p>
    In that case, please message us - Básar is a large campground and
    popular with families, and Þórsmörk (well, Iceland in general) is
    a great environment for kids with wide open spaces and no
    poisounous plants or animals. The nature however can be dangerous
    (fast, deep, cold rivers and steep rock faces) so it's good to be
    prepared.
</p>

            </article><article id="clothing" class="whatToBring">
                <header>Clothing</header>
                
<p>
    A 3-season sleeping bag, pillow and an inflatable camping mattress
    is all you need, even if you're in a tent - again, think
    Glastonbury.
</p>
<p>
    This also applies if you're staying in the hut (minus the
    mattress), but a light duvet and bedding also works.
